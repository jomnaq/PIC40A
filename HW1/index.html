        <h2> Silly Harmony Pictures and Stories </h2>
        <h3> Sitting at the Dining Table </h3>
        <p>
          Harmony loves to nose around the house looking for food, and when we're eating dinner, a lot of the 
          times she'll come up next to us, sit on one of the chairs, and look over the edge of the table, sniffing
          eagerly to see if there's anything she can steal away. I once caught a photo of her doing this, and it reminded
          me of a popular meme where a cat is sitting in front of a salad at a table. So, I recreated the meme but with
          a picture of Harmony.

        <h3> Wearing the Silly Rabbit Hat </h3>
        <p>
          Once, I brought home a rabbit hat to put on Harmony. Even though in these pictures she looks
          pretty calm, she actually hated it. She would wiggle her head desperately trying to get it off, 
          and couldn't keep the hat on for more than a few seconds. Luckily, at least I was able to snatch
          a few photos of her wearing it!
        </p>

        <h3> Favorite Napping Spots </h3>
          <p>
            Harmony is a huge napper. If you ever find her during the day, she will probably be asleep.
            Her favorite places to nap are usually our living room couch and random chairs throughout the house.
            When she's asleep, don't go up to her and pet her, because she <i>will</i> swat your hand away!
          </p>

        <h3> The Death Glare </h3>
        <p>
          Harmony is infamous for her death stare. Many times we can't tell if she's actually giving
          us the death stare of if she simply has her eyes half shut because she's tired. Either way,
          she can look like a pretty formidable cat at times...
